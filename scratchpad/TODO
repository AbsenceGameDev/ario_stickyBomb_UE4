Issues:
  - Projectile Color not changing in timeline
  - OnHit collision does not detect BaseShooter class, maybe because I'm actually hitting a derived class instead?
    - Seems like the projectile does not have any owner, maybe it needs to be explicitly set when spawning?
  - Set up Collision channels?
  - Add damage-radius variable to projectle class as-well as fleshing out TriggerExplosion. (Check native hit/attack events)

(TESTED & REPLICATION WORKS FOR ANYTHING ESSENTIAL): 
  ✔ Networking: Replicate PlayerMovement @done(21-07-28 12:24)
  ✔ Networking: Replicate HealthComponent @done(21-07-28 15:49)

(NOT TESTED BUT REPLICATION SHOULD WORK FOR ANYTHING ESSENTIAL): 
  ✔ Networking: Replicate ProjectileActor -> In OnHit function, check aactor role, also check aactor role in OnExplode() @done(21-07-28 15:51)
  - Networking: Replicate WeaponSkeletalMeshComponent
  - Networking: Replicate AmmoComponent

(NOT WORKING):
  - Networking: Crashes when switching CLient in PIE, seem to be related to the Timeline Component in the projectile, maybe it isn't replicated properly
