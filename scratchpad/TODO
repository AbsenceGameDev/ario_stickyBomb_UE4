TOP PRIO: 
  ✔ 1. Finish the Attach on hit Code @done(21-08-02 16:58) 
  - 2. ^ Write logic in gamemode to fetch correct UniqueID for any object regarding the client in question. 
      Clients will view same objects as different due to local UniqueID is not the same as Server,
      In gamemode, fetch gamestate, and player array? This is an offshoot of 7. in this list.

  ✔ 3. Finish the Pickup Actor Code // Remake, press bound Interact button to linetrace camera normal, resulting hit, if has interact interface gets interacted with @done(21-07-31 15:16)
  ✔ 4. Fix VFX/SFX Not playing @done(21-07-31 04:58)
  ✔ 5. Replicated pitch from player movement @done(21-08-01 16:23)
  - 6. Make sure StickyLineTraceComponent passes a linetrace through the player-capsule
  - 7. ordered map of all live players {int ID, ABaseShooter* BaseChar}, fetch correct Character from the map 

TODO:
  GENERAL:
    ✔ Restructure/Reordering decl. and def. @done(21-07-29 12:27)
      Regarding cohesiveness in their placements (Not refactoring).

    ☐ Refactor if needed, try to remove dead code.
    ✔ Remove superflous UE_LOGs. @done(21-07-30 23:00)
    ☐ Doxygen compatible comment blocks in headers.
    ☐ Generate doxyblock documentation with doxygen.

  INTERACTION INTERFACE:
    -> Currently it is a very naive and bugprone implementation, 
      It is likely that I won't have time to implement something somewhat sophisticated

        Location Quantization: Round to two decimals
        Velocity Quantization: Round to two decimals
        
        2. Rewrite Spawn projectile code to something more like this 
          a. Spawn the Projectile Replicated on the Server
          b. Calculate the Movement on Client and Server (no replication yet)
          c. Let the Server replicate his Movement
