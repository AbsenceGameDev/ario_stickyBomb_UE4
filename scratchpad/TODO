TODO:
  GENERAL:
    ✔ Restructure/Reordering decl. and def. @done(21-07-29 12:27)
      Regarding cohesiveness in their placements (Not refactoring).

    ☐ Refactor if needed.
    ☐ Remove superflous UE_LOGs.
    ☐ Doxygen compatible comment blocks in headers.
    ☐ Generate doxyblock documentation with doxygen.

  NETWORKING: 
    Networking: Replicate Movement:
      ☐ -> Pitch is not replicated, should be.
    Networking: Replicate VFX/SFX:          
      ☐ -> VFX/SFX should be run on client only.  
    Networking: Replicate ProjectileActor:  
      ☐ -> In OnHit function, Attach to bone of hit character
      ☐ -> Smoothen Movement
        1. Set as default to smoothen movement
        Location Quantization: Round to two decimals
        Velocity Quantization: Round to two decimals
        
        2. Rewrite Spawn projectile code to something more like this 
          a. Spawn the Projectile Replicated on the Server
          b. Calculate the Movement on Client and Server (no replication yet)
          c. Let the Server replicate his Movement 
    Networking: Replicate HealthComponent:
      ☐ -> Make TryHeal(health), OnHeal(health), and OnServerHeal(health) functions.
    Networking: Replicate Timeline Comp. :
      ✔ -> Crashes when switching CLient in PIE, @done(21-07-29 16:59)
        Seemed related to the projectiles Timeline Component when checking the callstack.

  COMPONENTS:
    ☐ StickyProjectile: Change Projectile color. 
    ☐ StickyProjectile: Detect hits on BaseShooter. 
    ☐ StickyProjectile: Set up collision channels.
    ☐ StickyProjectile: Broadcast radial damage.
