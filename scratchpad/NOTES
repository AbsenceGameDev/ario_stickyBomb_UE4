Here is the code test:

= Sticky Bomb =

Everything should be in C++, with variables (if and where necessary) exposed in BP

* Use the UE4 first person shooter template

* The default weapon should shoot exactly where you are aiming at
  Conclusion -- Linetrace, no projectile class (Maybe? not sure)

* The player starts with 3 ammo
    * Ammo count should be visible on screen (UI)
    * Use OnAmmoChanged event to update the UI
    * -1 count for each projectile shot
    * +1 if/when projectile is picked up

* The projectile should only attach to characters (any other surface and it will bounce) - Note: You can use the default UE4 skeletal mesh and animations.
* If the projectile attaches to a character, it will explode after 4 seconds (otherwise it will explode after 8 seconds)
  * The projectile will start blinking (color change) 3 seconds before exploding.
  * The speed of the blink (color change) will increase as the closer it gets to exploding.

* It should be possible to pick up the bomb before it explodes.
  * A floating UI element should show "Press E to Pickup"

* If the player pickups the bomb, it should add the ammo back to its count
* All the features should work in a multiplayer environment.

 

We estimated it at 2 to 4 days of work. Do you think you might be able to have it finished by Friday or Monday next week?

Feel free to add me on Discord: Adrien David#1576 and let me know if you have any questions on the test.

Good luck!

Cheers,

=================
Conclusion: 
  -- ALL SYSTEMS BELOW MUST WORK IN MULTIPLAYER ENVIRONMENT.

  -- Use the UE4 First Person C++ template. (Done, Made my own version instead)
  -- Expose variables to BP if necessary.

  -- Write a Health-system/module (Partly Done, widget and networking left)
    -- Have variables for HP (and possibly stamina) 
    -- Add methods to receive and remove health (and possibly stamina).
    -- Create onHealthChanged event and use it to update UI

  -- Write a Weapons class (Partly Done, widget and networking left)
    -- shootProjectile method that triggers OnAmmoChanged event if successful
    -- has simple ammo structure, possibly clamped on ammo pickup / etc
    -- (can be destroyed? Possibly, explore idea after the rest is implemented)

  -- Write a simple interaction interface. (Not Started)
    -- Implement the interface on the character, the ui, the weapon & the projectile class.

  -- Write a projectile class (Partly Done, need to add networked interaction (Picking it up))
    -- Can be interacted (Picked up or Held, Held will not stop it's timer?) using the above menttioned interface
    -- Picked up projectiles will be re-added to the ammo.
    -- Should attach to skeletal meshes only, should bounce on any other mesh.
    -- Has an explosion timer, 8 seconds if it doesn't attach to a character, 4 seconds if it does attach to a character. (Get free explosion sounds?)
    -- Projectile starts blinking colors 3 seconds before exploding (Blinking speed increases through interpolation, or perhaps step-wise)

  -- Write some UMG classes to handle UI elements, prompts such as:
    -- Ammo-count and/or health.
    -- Crosshair when pressing aim button?
    -- Red flashes when loosing health/getting hit.
    -- Interaction menu (maybe circular?)
      -- "Press E to Pickup"
      -- "Press H to grab and hold"
